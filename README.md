I'm a developer forged in discipline, not just code.

## ðŸ”¥ About Me

I'm not here for surface-level progress. I'm building a new chapter through real effort, consistent projects and continuous study. No shortcuts. Just structure, clarity and a relentless drive to grow.

## ðŸŒ± Currently Exploring

- Advanced JavaScript patterns  
- Full-stack application flow
